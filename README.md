# JPMorgan Chase Financial Variance Analysis (2019–2024)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes year-over-year financial performance variance at JPMorgan Chase using publicly available 10-K data. The focus is on understanding what changed, when, and why, with careful attention to event-driven periods.

## Methodology
- Structured financial data in a relational SQLite database
- Mapped database columns directly to reported line items from Form 10-K
- Used SQL window functions to calculate year-over-year variance and trends
- Contextual notes capture one-time or macro-driven events

## Key Observations
- Revenue and net income generally grew 2019–2024, with dips in 2020 due to COVID-19
- Credit loss provisions spiked in 2020, stabilizing in later years
- First Republic acquisition impacted 2023 results (noted in 'notes')
- Operating expenses grew slower than revenue in most years, indicating operational leverage

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data modeling & database design
- SQL (window functions, variance calculations)
- Business analysis & financial interpretation
- Documentation & audit trail creation

## Data Sources
All figures taken directly from JPMorgan Chase & Co. Form 10-K / Annual Reports (2019–2023). 2024 is illustrative.
